README

This program uses Ruby version 2.3 as well as several gems. Also, the program is
	run entirely within the command prompt.

Ruby install guide:

	+ If using OSX or linux: 
		While in the command prompt type "ruby-install" and let it work its magic

	+ If using Windows within the folder titled "build" well be a package calles
		"rubyinstaller-2.3.3.exe". Simply extract the package and follow the
		installation guide.

Ruby gems install guide:
	
	+ Since we will be using ruby 2.3 we do not need to install ruby gems in a specific manner,
		irregardless of what ever platform you are using.

Ruby gems that are required and how to install them:
	
	+ In order run the program correctly a few gems must be installed. In order to install the gems
		one need only type "gem install GEM_NAME" within the command prompt. Thats it!

		For example: "gem install nokogiri"

	+ The ruby gems required for this program are as follows:
		- rubygems
		- nokogiri
		- open-uri
		- json
		- neatjson

At this point you are ready to run my program, in order to do so do the following:

	+ In the command prompt change to the root directory, the directory that contains pack_a_book.rb
	+ Type in "ruby pack_a_book.rb" and press enter
	+ Follow th instructions given once the program is running
	+ Once the program is complete the final product should be placed within the root 
		directory's output folder

Take care and I hope you enjoy using pack-a-book!
