#Solution to AllMyBooksArePacked

Hi Team Datafiniti,

Please check out 'books.json' which is the output of my python program.
The source files can be found inside 'src/main/python/' folder.

* bookparser.py
    Contains methods to make a book object (dictionary) from parsed HTML.
    
* extract.py
    Parses each HTML file. Makes a list of books.

* collect.py
    Given a list of books, collects some of them to put in a box.
    Modifies the original list to contain only the remaining books.

* allocate.py
    Allocates a given list of books to N boxes of capacity 10 pounds each.
    Writes the list of boxes to a json file named 'books.json'
