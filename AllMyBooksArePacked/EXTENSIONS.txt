How my app could handle the following:

1. Domains beyond Amazon.com: 
For this situation I can save the HTML files inside the public folder and later start scraping the HTML
extracting the information we need from the site. 

Another approach is add a Form inside the app, in order to search to an online HTML page by using copy/paste
the URL of the page (before that we had reviewed and scraped the web page).

2. Products beyond just simply books:
Web scrape almost cover any type of product, some sites are banned and protected from being scraped, but
in general we can scrape any product/information we need, using the right tools and the algorithm.

3. Parse and ship 2,000,000 books:
Well for this sceneario the Knapsack algorithm probably could help, definetely for that we need to use data
algorithm and test the time it takes to produce the result we are looking for. Also use concepts like
Dynamic Programming.
