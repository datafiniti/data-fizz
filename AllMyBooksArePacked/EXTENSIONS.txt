-Domains beyond Amazon.com
-Products beyond just simply books.
-Parse and ship 2,000,000 books (in a reasonably time frame; e.g., polynomial time) instead of merely 20.

* My Code already use url to request the site html and be able to parce. Its already able to use any domain.
* We only need to now the structure of the html, and the way we want to parse, as I use cheerios to implement jquery form the server side.
* Right now it already open to any amount of url, you need to pass a array with all the urls we need to parse.
