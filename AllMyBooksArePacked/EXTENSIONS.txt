1) Domains beyond Amazon.com

  Add a new concern that maps the new site to the books model

2) Products beyond just simply books.

  Simply create a new model that belongs to boxes, create a function to pack that object in a box, then create a concern that populates the fields of the new model

3) Parse and ship 2,000,000 books (in a reasonably time frame; e.g., polynomial time) instead of merely 20.

  Create multiple treads that all parse books at the same time.  (A lock would need to be created for packing boxes to make it thread safe.)
