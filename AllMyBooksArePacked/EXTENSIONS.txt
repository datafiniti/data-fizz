how your application could be extended to handle the following:

1) Domains beyond Amazon.com
R/= Since all the pages are different, we will need to add a new folder and a new parser file for the new domain.Another alternative
could be setting up a server and instead of taking the html from a file we can ask for a list of links, in this case we will need to
update the parser function to accept different domains.

2) Products beyond just simply books.
R/= Since we are going to get different products we need to take in consideration that some of the properties are just for books like the author,
if we are planning to change the structure of the resulted json we need to make some changes in the in the current parser function.

3) Parse and ship 2,000,000 books (in a reasonably time frame; e.g., polynomial time) instead of merely 20.
R/= The current algorithm finish in (n log n) * n,  since we are sorting and then iterating the array, to improve the time we will need
to implement a better algorithm.
