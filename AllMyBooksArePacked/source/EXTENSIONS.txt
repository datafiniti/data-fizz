EXTENSIONS - How to handle additionalâ€¦


1. Domains beyond Amazon.com
 - If similar data is available (title, author, weight) then biggest change would be 
   updating html parser module to accommodate the various site structures

2. Products beyond just simply books.
 - Again a big change would be updating the parser module to accomadate
 - item module would need additional classes for new items
 - Small additional changes to other modules

3. Parse and ship 2,000,000 books instead of 20 (in a reasonable time frame; e.g. polynomial time).
 - The current implemented linear sort algorithm would be most ideal for such a large 
   dataset and possibly modified to be more efficient in the use of space.  The 
   current implementation of the dynamic programming decision tree would not be ideal 
   due to the space consumption and size of recursive calls.  The linear sort algorithm
   would also allow for books to be continuously added in real time.
 - implement back-end database for storage rather than utilize computer memory for each
   product extracted
