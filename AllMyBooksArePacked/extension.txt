Getting Data From different Domains:

We need to have all URL's for specific Websites. We should Store them in the database from that URL's we can navigate to different pages and fetch the data. 
We can also store the information about specific webpages address in the database.
We have many libraries which does this task.

To Support different type of products
-> For each product we need to have attributes which describe the product. 
We need to get the path of the Particular product in the html file and store it's address or it's relative class neme in table so that fetching becomes easier.


Reducing the time Complexity.

Reducing Complexity of Bin Packing Algorithm:
We can use self balacing trees instead of a list data structures which reduces more time.
We can create a binary search tree or AVL trees to check or fit the item. When it doesn't have any new space we will add a new node into tree with capacity
Else we will rebalance tree with available spaces. This will reduce the time complexity.

Using Mutlithreading:

We can use multithreading or Processing Parallel Collection will reduce the time. Each thread can fetch a specific page and updates the list.
and packs the item.
