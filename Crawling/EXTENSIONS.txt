1. Domains beyond Amazon.com

While the app is specific to Amazon books, it can be extended by adding navigation functions for each domain.
Possibly use find() to get selectors for each variable so you can re-use the array.reduce function for scraping
, or again write specific functions for each domain. Also must have all functions in their own modules to be
called in server.js for easier re-usability.


2. Products beyond just simply books

I did test this code with other products. It worked a few times, but the majority of the time it returned an
error thanks to different layouts/elements in different product listings and/or product pages. I believe this
can be fixed by adding if statements to see if certain selectors exists, or find() to find selectors with
certain attributes. With the element selector fixed, you can re-use the scraping function, or once again create
specific scraping functions for different categories.
