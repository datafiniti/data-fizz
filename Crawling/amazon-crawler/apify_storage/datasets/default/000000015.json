But first, we've got to stop living in fear of being judged for who we are.\"\nRachel Hollis has seen it too often: women not living into their full potential.

She knows that many women have been taught to define themselves in light of other people - whether as wife, mother, daughter, or employee - instead of learning how to own who they are and what they want. With a challenge to women everywhere to stop talking themselves out of their dreams, Hollis identifies the excuses to let go of, the behaviors to adopt, and the skills to acquire on the path to growth, confidence, and believing in yourself. \nAs an audiobook exclusive, join Rachel in a guided meditation bonus track designed to ground you in gratitude with focus and intention! \nPLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Library on Audible.com. ,\"I believe we can change the world.
