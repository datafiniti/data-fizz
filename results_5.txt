Born with red pupils, he was called &#x201c;Devil Boy&#x201d; or Sam &#x201c;Hell&#x201d; by his classmates; &#x201c;God&#x2019;s will&#x201d; is what his mother called his ocular albinism. Her words were of little comfort, but Sam persevered, buoyed by his mother&#x2019;s devout faith, his father&#x2019;s practical wisdom, and his two other misfit friends.  Sam believed it was God who sent Ernie Cantwell, the only African American kid in his class, to be the friend he so desperately needed. And that it was God&#x2019;s idea for Mickie Kennedy to storm into Our Lady of Mercy like a tornado, uprooting every rule Sam had been taught about boys and girls.  Forty years later, Sam, a small-town eye doctor, is no longer certain anything was by design&#x2014;especially not the tragedy that caused him to turn his back on his friends, his hometown, and the life he&#x2019;d always known. Running from the pain, eyes closed, served little purpose. Now, as he looks back on his life, Sam embarks on a journey that will take him halfway around the world. This time, his eyes are wide open&#x2014;bringing into clear view what changed him, defined him, and made him so afraid, until he can finally see what truly matters. ",

    "description": " #1&nbsp; NEW YORK TIMES &nbsp;BESTSELLER    Do you ever suspect that everyone else has life figured out and you don&rsquo;t have a clue? If so, Rachel Hollis has something to tell you:&nbsp; that&rsquo;s a lie .   As the founder of the lifestyle website&nbsp;TheChicSite.com&nbsp;and CEO of her own media company, Rachel Hollis developed an immense online community by sharing tips for better living while fearlessly revealing the messiness of her own life. Now, in this challenging and inspiring new book, Rachel exposes the twenty lies and misconceptions that too often hold us back from living joyfully and productively, lies we&rsquo;ve told ourselves so often we don&rsquo;t even hear them anymore.  With painful honesty and fearless humor, Rachel unpacks and examines the falsehoods that once left her feeling overwhelmed and unworthy, and reveals the specific practical strategies that helped her move past them. In the process, she encourages, entertains, and even kicks a little butt, all to convince you to do whatever it takes to get real and become the joyous, confident woman you were meant to be.

    "description": "  NEW YORK TIMES  BESTSELLER   In this pioneering, practical book, Daniel J. Siegel, neuropsychiatrist and author of the bestselling  Mindsight , and parenting expert Tina Payne Bryson offer a revolutionary approach to child rearing with twelve key strategies that foster healthy brain development, leading to calmer, happier children. The authors explain&mdash;and make accessible&mdash;the new science of how a child&rsquo;s brain is wired and how it matures. The &ldquo;upstairs brain,&rdquo; which makes decisions and balances emotions, is under construction until the mid-twenties. And especially in young children, the right brain and its emotions tend to rule over the logic of the left brain. No wonder kids throw tantrums, fight, or sulk in silence. By applying these discoveries to everyday parenting, you can turn any outburst, argument, or fear into a chance to integrate your child&rsquo;s brain and foster vital growth.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;   &#160;  Complete with age-appropriate strategies for dealing with day-to-day struggles and illustrations that will help you explain these concepts to your child,  The Whole-Brain Child  shows you how to cultivate healthy emotional and intellectual development so that your children can lead balanced, meaningful, and connected lives.   &#160;   From the Trade Paperback edition.

Born with red pupils, he was called &#x201c;Devil Boy&#x201d; or Sam &#x201c;Hell&#x201d; by his classmates; &#x201c;God&#x2019;s will&#x201d; is what his mother called his ocular albinism. Her words were of little comfort, but Sam persevered, buoyed by his mother&#x2019;s devout faith, his father&#x2019;s practical wisdom, and his two other misfit friends.  Sam believed it was God who sent Ernie Cantwell, the only African American kid in his class, to be the friend he so desperately needed. And that it was God&#x2019;s idea for Mickie Kennedy to storm into Our Lady of Mercy like a tornado, uprooting every rule Sam had been taught about boys and girls.  Forty years later, Sam, a small-town eye doctor, is no longer certain anything was by design&#x2014;especially not the tragedy that caused him to turn his back on his friends, his hometown, and the life he&#x2019;d always known. Running from the pain, eyes closed, served little purpose. Now, as he looks back on his life, Sam embarks on a journey that will take him halfway around the world. This time, his eyes are wide open&#x2014;bringing into clear view what changed him, defined him, and made him so afraid, until he can finally see what truly matters. ",
