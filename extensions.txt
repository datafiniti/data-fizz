How could your application be extended to handle the following:

1. Domains beyond Amazon.com

  Since we've already created an object for what a book entails, you could simply
  create another object that extends the built-in HTMLParser object, as the
  current AmazonParser does. The Box, Shipment, and Book objects, and
  their associated methods, remain the same, but the scraping procedure changes.

2. Products beyond just simply books.

  In a similar light, the box object could be modified to be more analogous to a
  real-world box, which can hold any number of things. You could change the
  init() function to take the obligatory self parameter, as well as a **kwargs
  parameter, which would give the object more flexibility. Alternatively, you can
  simply strip it down further and create subsequent objects like BookBox or
  MovieBox, what have you, that extend the original Box object and its methods.

3. Parse and ship 2,000,000 books (in a reasonably time frame; e.g., polynomial time) instead of merely 20.

  Currently the box packing algorithm is a greedy algorithm. It sorts the parcels
  in reverse order, and packs boxes with books as they fit in by weight. To parse
  and ship two million books quickly, you could split those two million books into
  smaller chunks, and run multiple parsers at once on every chunk. Additionally,
  you could use concurrency to split the parsing and shipping processes.
